# springboot-springcloud
This repo consolidates different pieces of Spring cloud ecosystem that are needed for creating a set of springboot microservices. 

You can either clone and run these services on your local machine or use folder spring-cloud-cft-templates that has CloudFormation scripts for spinning up EC2 instances that can be used for hosting all these different services.
